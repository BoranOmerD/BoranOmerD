- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @BoranOmerD
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in iOS app development. I know Swift-SwiftUI at medium-high level and I aim to improve myself in this direction. Apart from that, I have produced many projects in software languages such as Java, Python, C, many of which are artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently continuing to improve myself on Swift and SwiftUI. I am also learning 3rd party libraries like Cocopod and trying to include them in my projects. I am also trying to learn Google Gemini and Firebase and trying to include them in my projects.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me from this email -> omerdogan138@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun information: I like going to the gym, swimming and eating Asian food
